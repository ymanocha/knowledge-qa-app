## Note to Reviewer
I chose to build this using a "Raw" approach (no heavy RAG frameworks) to demonstrate:
1.  Understanding of the underlying linear algebra (Cosine Similarity).
2.  Ability to architect a clean, modular backend without dependencies.
3.  Focus on production readiness (deployment, error handling, security) over feature bloat.
